# SDEV-425-Homework-3
This assignment provided me with a source code that is riddled with security issues. This assignment is a simple C menu application. The goal of the assignment is to mitigate any security flaws that may be present by implementing security controls, testing those controls, and documenting the results. Some of the security controls necessary are:  * STR31-C. Guarantee that storage for strings has sufficient space for character data and the null terminator. * MSC24-C. Do not use deprecated or obsolescent functions. * FIO34-C. Distinguish between characters read from a file and EOF or WEOF. * MSC17-C. Finish every set of statements associated with a case label with a break statement. * MSC33-C. Do not pass invalid data to the asctime() function. * DCL20-C. Explicitly specify void when a function accepts no arguments. * MEM30-C. Do not access freed memory.  In addition to the code I have screen captured and documented everything in a MS word file. Enjoy!
